# icecream.handlebars

from a codecademy lesson

this is mainly a quick reference for me

Project ideas:
use w/ forms? can create interactivity w/o backend using handlebars? Can use something other than innerHTML or have to use code to filter user input?

use w/ api's being the "context"?

note in l.js
git
